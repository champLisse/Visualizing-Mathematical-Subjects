# Visualizing-Mathematical-Subjects

These are some simple R-scripts to visualize the network of mathematical subjects.

- Harvester.R is to download the metadata from the arXiv.
- creategraph.R processes this metatadata into an igraph graph.
- plotgraph.R plots this graph.

There are some example outputs as well.
